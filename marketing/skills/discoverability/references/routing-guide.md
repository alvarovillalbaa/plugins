## Discoverability Priorities

1. **Technical foundation first**: Fix crawlability and indexability before optimizing content.
2. **AI-crawler rules**: Explicitly configure robots.txt for AI crawlers — don't rely on defaults.
3. **llms.txt**: Every site should have `/llms.txt` for AI agent discoverability.
4. **Measure AI traffic**: Set up GA4 AI referrer tracking before optimization work begins.
5. **Content quality drives GEO**: AI citations follow E-E-A-T signals — invest in expertise signals.
