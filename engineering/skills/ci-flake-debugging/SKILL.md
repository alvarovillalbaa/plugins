# CI Flake Debugging

This child skill owns CI failures, flaky tests, ordering problems, environment drift, cache issues, and quality gate recovery. It carries the detailed assets for this lane after the corrected fragmentation split.

## Use When

- The request is primarily about CI failures, flaky tests, ordering problems, environment drift, cache issues, and quality gate recovery.
- The parent router [`../quality-assurance/SKILL.md`](../quality-assurance/SKILL.md) selects this child.
- The work needs this lane's references, scripts, examples, hooks, or templates.

## Assets

- `references/` contains lane-specific guidance moved from the original parent skill.
- `scripts/` contains executable helpers owned by this lane.
- `templates/` contains reusable output or implementation templates for this lane.
- `examples/` contains sample inputs, outputs, or usage artifacts.
- `hooks/` contains hook entrypoints only when this lane owns hook behavior.

## Chain Rules

- Chain to `pentest`, `ai-engineering/ai-evals-observability`, `frontend`, `backend`, `pr-management`, `cloud-management` when the task crosses this child's boundary.
- Use repo-local personalization documents for company, product, voice, cloud, QA, or finance facts instead of hardcoding them here.
- Preserve parent safety and approval rules for destructive, security-sensitive, finance-sensitive, or cloud-costly work.

## External Skill Chains

Use live external skills when they are installed. If one is missing, report the fallback command instead of copying its guidance inline. Local skill rules, repo-specific facts, safety gates, product/channel constraints, and explicit local exceptions win over external guidance when they conflict.

- `deslop`: Remove AI-generated code slop from the current diff without changing behavior. Install: `python scripts/install-external-skills.py --skill deslop --agent codex`.
- `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`: Run an unusually strict maintainability and abstraction-quality review. Install: `python scripts/install-external-skills.py --skill thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review --agent codex`.
- `no-mistakes`: Gate explicit ship, push, PR, or validate flows through the no-mistakes pipeline. Install: `python scripts/install-external-skills.py --skill no-mistakes --agent codex`.
- `improve`: Run a read-only senior codebase audit and write execution-ready plans for other agents. Install: `python scripts/install-external-skills.py --skill improve --agent codex`.
