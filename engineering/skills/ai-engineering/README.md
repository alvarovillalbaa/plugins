# AI Engineering

Router skill for AI system architecture, prompt/tool design, context and memory/RAG, AI eval observability, agent governance/safety, data/ML pipelines, and computer vision systems.

**This parent is a router.** Select the narrowest child skill and load that child before using lane-specific assets.

## Fine-Tuning Ownership Note

`fine-tuning.md` lives under `agent-system-architecture/references/` and covers agent-behavior tuning strategy (when to tune, dataset tiers, SFT job launch, post-training gates). `data-ml-pipelines` owns dataset construction ops, training infrastructure, and model evaluation. These overlap by design — see cross-links in both files.
