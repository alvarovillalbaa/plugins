# Documentation Types Reference

Last updated: 2026-06-28

Canonical taxonomy for documentation types, where they live, and whether they are historical or living.

## Surfaces

Documentation falls into these surfaces:

1. Inline docs
2. In-folder docs
3. Root instruction docs
4. Timestamped historical AFS docs
5. Living AFS docs

Default rule: choose the narrowest authoritative surface first.

## Inline docs

Use inline docs for public functions, classes, methods, hooks, components, modules, and non-obvious code behavior that should be visible without leaving the editor.

Prefer type annotations over prose when types can carry the meaning cleanly.

## In-folder docs

These explain one directory or subsystem.

### Core

- `README.md`
- `ARC.md`

### Conditional

- `SETUP.md`
- `RUNBOOK.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `SECURITY.md`

### Rare

- `OVERVIEW.md`
- `FAQ.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`

### What each one does

- `README.md` — purpose, entry point, usage, links
- `ARC.md` — internals, flows, boundaries, decisions
- `SETUP.md` — non-obvious bootstrap or local environment steps
- `RUNBOOK.md` — folder-local operational workflow
- `CHANGELOG.md` — user-facing or package-facing release history
- `SECURITY.md` — security boundaries, secrets, abuse cases, review rules
- `OVERVIEW.md` — concept-first orientation when README would become too dense
- `FAQ.md` — repeated questions and troubleshooting
- `DECISIONS.md` — local decisions that do not justify a separate ADR
- `DEPENDENCIES.md` — dependency map, contracts, upgrade notes

These are living docs. Add `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD` near the top.

## Root instruction docs

These are first-class documentation:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | General customization to the user's needs, codebase, and ways of working |
| `PLAN.md` | How planning should be done and how plans should look |
| `SPEC.md` | How specs should be written and how they should be maintained |
| `SOUL.md` | Agent personality and collaboration stance |
| `PRINCIPLES.md` | Constraints, heuristics, and max/min rules |
| `DESIGN.md` | Design-system and frontend interaction guidance |

These are living docs. Add `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD` near the top.

## Final AFS

### Memory

| Path | Purpose | Default mode |
|---|---|---|
| `logs/` | terse change log for meaningful code or doc changes | timestamped |
| `lessons/` | reusable lessons learned from experience, organized by domain | timestamped |
| `facts/` | durable facts: `facts/items/<domain>/`, `facts/episodes/<domain>/`, `facts/triples/<domain>/` | living |
| `fixes/` | reusable debugging solutions and error fixes | timestamped |
| `steers/` | traces of agent work steered or corrected by a human or secondary LLM | timestamped |
| `models/` | brief logs of decisions made, problems encountered, or goals set | timestamped |
| `reflections/` | detailed reflections grounded in the platform and recent experience | timestamped |

### Operational

| Path | Purpose | Default mode |
|---|---|---|
| `audits/` | reports, audits, ADRs, post-mortems, investigations | timestamped |
| `raw/` | raw source material waiting to be ingested | timestamped |
| `plans/` | implementation plans and plan-driven-development artifacts | timestamped |
| `results/` | stored work outputs and computed results | timestamped |
| `specs/` | living desired-state behavior contracts | living |
| `sources/` | monitored URL/source registries | living |
| `lib/` | generated drafts, registries, support artifacts | living |
| `objects/<type>/` | structured objects such as clients, employees, or companies | living |
| `templates/` | reusable artifacts such as AI prompts, emails, or document templates | living |
| `<domain>/<folder>/` | domain-specific surfaces only when truly needed | repo-defined |

### Source of truth

| Path | Purpose | Default mode |
|---|---|---|
| `references/` | factual code, API, schema, or URL references | living |
| `cookbooks/` | "how we actually do this here" recipes | living |
| `knowledge/` | timeless maintained knowledge | living |
| `runbooks/` | operational procedures | living |
| `research/` | ongoing research work | living |
| `official-documentation/` | copied external official docs | living, but not iterated heavily |

## Timestamp rule

Timestamped doc families use one layout only:

```text
*/YYYY/MM-DD/*.md
```

Default timestamped families:

- `logs/`
- `lessons/`
- `fixes/`
- `steers/`
- `models/`
- `reflections/`
- `audits/`
- `raw/`
- `plans/`
- `results/`

Default living families with type-first structure:

- `facts/items/<domain>/`
- `facts/episodes/<domain>/`
- `facts/triples/<domain>/`

Examples:

```text
logs/2026/04-25/changes.md
lessons/engineering/2026/04-25/retry-budget.md
fixes/2026/04-25/postgres-socket-timeout.md
steers/2026/04-25/api-route-correction.md
models/2026/04-25/auth-decision.md
reflections/2026/04-25/sprint-retrospective.md
audits/2026/04-25/release-audit.md
plans/2026/04-25/queue-backpressure.md
raw/2026/04-25/vendor-export.md
results/2026/04-25/report.md
facts/items/general/team-size.md
facts/episodes/onboarding/2026-04-25-first-week.md
facts/triples/product/pricing-model.md
```

## Living-doc rule

Living docs do not use timestamped folders as their primary organization.

Every living doc should include:

```markdown
Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

Put it directly under the H1 or immediately after frontmatter.

Applies to:

- root instruction docs
- in-folder docs
- `facts/`
- `specs/`
- `sources/`
- `lib/`
- `references/`
- `cookbooks/`
- `knowledge/`
- `runbooks/`
- `research/`
- `official-documentation/`

## Time-based vs live conflicts

Use this rule whenever docs overlap:

- timestamped docs own history
- living docs own the current rule

Good split:

- `plans/2026/04-25/payment-retry.md` explains one implementation effort
- `PLAN.md` explains the lasting repo-wide planning standard

Bad split:

- current operational instructions duplicated in both `audits/...` and `runbooks/...`
- current repo rules duplicated in both `lessons/...` and `AGENTS.md`

When conflicts exist:

1. Move the durable rule into the right living doc.
2. Keep the timestamped doc only as evidence or archive.
3. Delete redundant drift when it adds no value.

## Decision guide

Use this routing sequence:

1. If the reader needs the answer inside code, use inline docs.
2. If the doc explains one folder, use in-folder docs.
3. If the doc changes how the repo is operated, use a root instruction doc.
4. If the artifact is historical, investigative, or event-like, use a timestamped AFS path.
5. If the artifact is the current durable truth, use a living AFS path.

## Common placements

| Scenario | Destination |
|---|---|
| Daily change note | `logs/YYYY/MM-DD/changes.md` |
| Durable lesson from repeated debugging | `lessons/<domain>/YYYY/MM-DD/` |
| Item fact about user/company/project | `facts/items/<domain>/` |
| Episode fact (session-scoped) | `facts/episodes/<domain>/` |
| Triple fact (atomic claim) | `facts/triples/<domain>/` |
| Non-obvious recurring fix | `fixes/YYYY/MM-DD/*.md` |
| Trace of agent correction or steering | `steers/YYYY/MM-DD/*.md` |
| Brief decision, problem, or goal log | `models/YYYY/MM-DD/*.md` |
| Detailed platform reflection | `reflections/YYYY/MM-DD/*.md` |
| Release audit or architecture report | `audits/YYYY/MM-DD/` |
| New feature implementation plan | `plans/YYYY/MM-DD/` |
| Structured object (client, employee, company) | `objects/<type>/` |
| Reusable template (prompt, email, document) | `templates/` |
| Repo-wide behavior contract | `specs/` |
| Work output or computed result | `results/YYYY/MM-DD/` |
| Stable API mapping | `references/` |
