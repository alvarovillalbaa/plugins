# Orchestrate Roles

Use this reference when distributing a large task across parallel cloud agents via `/orchestrate`. The pattern prevents context bleed, cross-talk, and scope drift that occur when a single long-running agent handles too much work.

## Core Model

Five distinct node types. Each has exactly one responsibility. Mixing them is the primary failure mode.

| Role | Responsibility | Does NOT do |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Dispatcher** | Kicks off the planner; receives the final URL. One-shot. | Code, plan, or review |
| **Planner** | Owns a scope; writes `plan.json`; publishes tasks; reads handoffs; loops until scope is done. | Write code directly |
| **Subplanner** | Recursively owns a sub-scope delegated by the planner. Aggregates results before handing back. | Skip aggregation |
| **Worker** | Executes one isolated task; returns one structured handoff. | Talk to sibling workers |
| **Verifier** | Validates acceptance criteria for a task slice. | Rewrite the task definition |

## Key Principles

**Planners own scope, workers own execution.**
A planner's job is to decompose work and track progress, not to implement. If a planner starts writing code, the plan will drift.

**No cross-talk.**
Workers operate independently in their own repo clone. Information flows vertically through structured handoffs — upward to the planner — never horizontally between siblings. Siblings that share state introduce race conditions and context bleed.

**Handoffs are the contract.**
A worker's output is a single structured handoff artifact (a file or JSON blob committed to the branch). The planner reads it, not the worker's conversation.

**plan.json is authoritative state.**
The planner writes `plan.json` as the living state of the work. If the planner is restarted, it re-reads `plan.json` to reconstruct context rather than relying on conversational memory. This prevents drift across long-running sessions.

**Continuous propagation.**
The planner has no "finished" state until it decides all tasks are done. It keeps publishing new tasks from handoffs. Stopping happens by the dispatcher calling `kill` or by the planner detecting an empty queue.

## State File: plan.json

```json
{
  "goal": "string — the original goal",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "scope": "string — what the worker owns",
      "status": "pending | running | done | failed",
      "handoff": "path/to/handoff.json or null",
      "worker_url": "string or null"
    }
  ],
  "completed_at": null
}
```

Update `status` and `handoff` atomically. Never leave `status: running` without a `worker_url`.

## Andon Pull Cord

Any worker or verifier can signal the planner to pause the pipeline by writing `andon: true` in their handoff. The planner reads this flag before publishing the next task and escalates to the dispatcher (human) instead of continuing. Use Andon when:

- A worker discovers the scope is wider than estimated (would affect > 3 other tasks)
- A verifier finds a fundamental spec ambiguity that blocks acceptance
- A worker encounters a security or destructive-operation boundary

The dispatcher resolves the issue and resumes the planner by clearing the `andon` flag and calling `respawn`.

## Dispatcher Entry Point (Local)

The dispatcher is the local IDE session. It never transitions to planner or worker mode.

```bash
bun skills/orchestrate/scripts/cli.ts kickoff "<goal>" [options]
# Returns: { agentId, runId, status, url }
```

Available subcommands: `run`, `spawn`, `respawn`, `kill`, `tail`, `comment`, `andon`.

Use `tail` to stream planner output without joining the session. Use `comment` to inject guidance. Use `andon` to pause and surface a decision.

## When to Use /orchestrate

Use when:
- The task spans multiple independent sub-scopes (each can be done in parallel without shared mutable state)
- A single agent would exceed its context budget partway through
- The work is too large for a single `/dev-loop` iteration ceiling
- Human supervision is desirable at the planner level, not at every worker step

Do NOT use when:
- Sub-tasks share mutable state that workers would need to read mid-flight
- The scope is unclear (orchestrating an ambiguous goal produces orphaned workers)
- The repo has no reliable verify command (workers cannot self-check their handoffs)
- You want fast iteration — the spawn/handoff cycle adds latency vs. direct execution

## Connection to Harness Loops

`/orchestrate` is for cloud-parallel execution of large scopes. `/dev-loop` and `/harness-loop` are for in-session iteration on a single agent. They are complementary:

- Use `/orchestrate` to break the epic into independently verifiable sub-scopes
- Use `/dev-loop` inside each worker session to iterate on that sub-scope
- Use `/harness-loop` after an orchestrated pass to enforce any new conventions discovered
