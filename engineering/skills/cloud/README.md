# Cloud Management

CLI-first cloud operations skill for AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## Use this for

- identifying which cloud estate a repo actually uses
- designing AWS, Azure, or GCP target architectures before provisioning
- deploying services or wiring CI/CD from the terminal
- inventory, optimization, and incident remediation
- cloud changes that need explicit approval gates and rollback thinking
