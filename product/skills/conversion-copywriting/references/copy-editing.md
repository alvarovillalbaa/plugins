# Copy Editing

Use this reference when the user already has market-facing copy and needs it improved without losing the core message, offer, or brand voice.

External owner boundary:

- Use `unslop` and `stop-slop` for AI-writing tells, filler, passive voice, rhythm, em dash rules, and prose cleanup.
- This file owns conversion logic: promise, proof, buyer stage, objections, CTA, and market-message fit.

Typical assets:
- landing page copy
- pricing page copy
- email copy
- launch announcements
- paid social or paid search copy
- homepage or feature-page sections

## Initial Assessment

Read `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` first if it exists. Reuse the established audience, voice, proof points, and customer language instead of re-deriving them.

Before editing, confirm:

1. **Asset type**
- Landing page
- Pricing page
- Email
- Ad
- Homepage
- Feature page

2. **Primary conversion**
- Trial signup
- Demo request
- Purchase
- Reply / click-through
- Upgrade

3. **Constraints**
- Character or layout limits
- Claims that need legal or product review
- Proof already available vs. proof still needed

---

## Editing Philosophy

- Improve the copy before rewriting it.
- Preserve the original promise unless the promise itself is wrong.
- Make one kind of improvement at a time; broad, unfocused rewrites miss leverage.
- Every recommendation should name the reason it improves conversion, clarity, or trust.
- Prefer the customer's language over internal shorthand.

## Seven Editing Sweeps

Run these passes in order. After each pass, make sure the earlier gains still hold.

### 1. Clarity

Goal: a new reader should understand what the product is, who it is for, and why it matters without extra interpretation.

Check for:
- jargon, abstract nouns, or insider language
- sentences that bury the point
- unclear pronouns or missing context
- multiple ideas crammed into one paragraph

Fix patterns:
- replace abstraction with concrete language
- front-load the outcome
- split overloaded sentences
- make the "for whom" explicit

### 2. Voice and Tone

Goal: the copy should sound like one brand and one author.

Check for:
- sudden shifts between casual and corporate
- inconsistent use of "we", "the team", or company name
- jokes or hype that appear in only one section
- terminology that breaks the brand voice

Fix patterns:
- normalize tone across sections
- reuse approved product terms
- remove personality that is inconsistent rather than weak

### 3. Benefit Bridge

Goal: every meaningful claim answers the buyer's implicit "why should I care?"

Check for:
- features presented without outcomes
- capabilities listed without business or user impact
- company-centric statements that never land on the buyer

Fix patterns:
- add "which means..." logic
- connect the feature to time saved, money saved, risk reduced, or status gained
- rewrite company achievements into customer consequences

### 4. Proof

Goal: major claims feel earned.

Check for:
- bold assertions without evidence
- social proof that is generic or unattributed
- outcomes with no numbers, timeframes, or examples
- trust language that is far from the CTA

Fix patterns:
- add testimonials, quantified outcomes, review signals, or customer names
- soften claims that cannot be supported
- move proof closer to decision points

### 5. Specificity

Goal: the copy should feel concrete, not interchangeable.

Check for:
- vague verbs like "improve", "optimize", or "streamline"
- round, suspicious, or unsupported numbers
- generic statements any competitor could claim
- missing examples, timeframes, or mechanisms

Fix patterns:
- swap adjectives for specifics
- add time, quantity, or scope
- explain how the result happens, not just that it happens

### 6. Emotional Weight

Goal: the copy should make the problem and desired outcome feel real enough to act on.

Check for:
- flat explanatory sections
- pain stated intellectually but not felt
- transformation described too clinically
- urgency or relief implied but not expressed

Fix patterns:
- sharpen the before/after contrast
- use concrete consequences of the current problem
- add emotionally resonant details without becoming melodramatic

### 7. Risk Reduction

Goal: remove hesitation near the action.

Check for:
- CTAs that ask for too much trust too early
- missing reassurance around pricing, card requirement, setup time, or privacy
- vague next steps after the CTA
- objections raised but not resolved

Fix patterns:
- add trial, guarantee, cancellation, or privacy reassurance where true
- clarify exactly what happens next
- pair CTA with proof or reassurance

## Quick-Pass Checks

Use this abbreviated pass when the user wants lighter editing.

### Word level

- run `unslop` or `stop-slop` for filler, inflated verbs, and AI-writing patterns
- remove vague nouns like "things", "stuff", or "solution" when a real noun exists

### Sentence level

- one idea per sentence
- keep the most important information early
- reduce stacked clauses and qualifiers

### Paragraph level

- one topic per paragraph
- open with the main point, not the setup
- end with the action, implication, or proof

---

## Deliverable Format

When editing existing copy, return:

### 1. What is already working

- strongest message
- strongest proof
- strongest CTA or section

### 2. Priority edits

For each edit:
- **Sweep**
- **Issue**
- **Why it matters**
- **Recommended rewrite**

### 3. Revised copy

Provide the improved version in the same structure as the original asset so the user can replace it directly.

### 4. Evidence gaps

List claims that still need proof, specificity, or validation from product / legal / customer evidence.

## Failure Modes

- rewriting the copy into a new strategy instead of improving the existing one
- polishing weak messaging without fixing the core value proposition
- adding urgency or certainty the product cannot support
- making voice more dramatic while lowering clarity
- changing claims without checking proof availability
- editing in isolation from the target conversion and buyer stage
