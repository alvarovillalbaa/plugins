# Operational Modes

Use this reference when the user asks for a concrete brain action rather than a broad architecture discussion.

These modes are storage-agnostic. They describe the workflow contract, not a required UI, slash command, or Obsidian feature.

## Shared rules

Apply these rules across all modes:

- count `BRAIN.md` files first when the scope might contain more than one second brain
- if no `BRAIN.md` exists, stay read-only unless the user explicitly asks to bootstrap
- if multiple `BRAIN.md` files exist in the target root, fail closed and ask which brain to target
- work inside the nearest relevant `BRAIN.md` boundary
- use the adaptation mode and folder mappings from `BRAIN.md`; default to strict AFS only when no local standard exists
- read the operating manual first when it exists
- use `INDEX.md`, hub pages, or the user's equivalent before broad searching
- search before creating so the system does not grow duplicate pages
- preserve raw sources when durable ingestion is wanted
- propagate meaningful changes to indexes, logs, boards, daily notes, and output registries
- report what was created, what was rewritten, what contradictions were found, and what still needs judgment

## Bootstrap or init mode

Use when the user wants to initialize, bootstrap, or align an existing corpus.

Default flow:

1. Count `BRAIN.md` files and identify the target brain root.
2. Map the current structure.
3. Inspect representative notes, templates, dashboards, boards, or instruction files.
4. Choose the adaptation mode: strict AFS, partial AFS, or native company standard.
5. Create or refresh `BRAIN.md`, `knowledge/INDEX.md`, and the current dated log file in `logs/` or their equivalents.
6. Preserve existing naming, metadata, and folder conventions when they already work.
7. If an operating manual already exists, diff mentally and avoid overwriting it without approval.

Goal: produce a usable navigation and maintenance layer without forcing a migration and without collapsing multiple brains into one.

## Save or session-capture mode

Use when the user says things like:

- save this conversation
- capture this meeting
- file this session
- update the second brain with what we just decided

Default flow:

1. Scan the conversation for decisions, tasks, people, projects, ideas, procedures, insights, and notable quotes.
2. Group updates by note type so related writes can happen coherently and in parallel when helpful.
3. Search for the existing canonical page for each durable item before creating anything new.
4. Update or create the relevant canonical pages.
5. Propagate links to the daily note, boards, project pages, and `LOG.md`.
6. Report where everything landed.

Goal: no orphan dump note, no duplicated entity page, no lost decision.

## Ingest mode

Use when the user provides a URL, file, pasted text, screenshot, transcript, PDF, audio, or another source and wants it absorbed into the knowledge base.

Default flow:

1. Classify the source type before processing it deeply.
2. Preserve the source in the raw layer when durable ingestion is wanted.
3. If the source is not readable enough to support durable claims, mark it blocked and stop before synthesis.
4. Extract entities, concepts, claims, decisions, procedures, tasks, dates, and quotes.
5. Update the relevant canonical pages by rewriting current-state sections, not just appending.
6. Create or refresh source-summary pages only when they add retrieval value.
7. Record contradictions, supersessions, and strengthened consensus explicitly.
8. Refresh `INDEX.md`, `LOG.md`, and any synthesis pages touched by the source.
9. Update today's note or another current-state log if the user keeps one.

If an ingest only creates new pages and rewrites nothing, it was probably too shallow.

## Memory-to-knowledge mode

Use when the user wants `knowledge/` iterated from repo Memory, or when a compile pass should include experience captured outside `raw/`.

Default inputs:

- `logs/`
- `lessons/`
- `facts/`
- `fixes/`
- `steers/`
- `models/`
- `reflections/`

Default flow:

1. Read `BRAIN.md` and identify whether the brain is strict AFS, partial AFS, or native.
2. Inventory Memory entries that are not already represented in canonical knowledge.
3. Search for existing owner pages before creating anything new.
4. Promote only durable learnings, procedures, facts, decisions, or recurring patterns.
5. Keep events and one-off session details in Memory; do not duplicate them into `knowledge/` unless they change the current truth.
6. Preserve source provenance by linking or naming the Memory entry that supported the update.
7. Record contradictions or stale knowledge in open threads.

## Daily refresh mode

Use when the user wants today's note, a session note, or a current-state refresh.

Default flow:

1. Create or update today's daily note or the user's equivalent.
2. Pull in due or overdue tasks from boards or operational pages.
3. Add calendar context only if a calendar integration exists and the user wants it.
4. Summarize overnight or recent changes from `LOG.md`, synthesis pages, or maintenance runs.
5. Seed the note with current work from the conversation when relevant.

Goal: the user can open one page and know what matters today.

## World or context-restore mode

Use when the user wants continuity, a boot-up sequence, or a fast context restore.

Load progressively:

- `L0`: `CRITICAL_FACTS.md`, `PINNED.md`, and identity/preferences
- `L1`: `INDEX.md` and recent `LOG.md`
- `L2`: current-state files, today's note, recent daily logs, active boards, active projects
- `L3`: deep project pages or raw sources only when the current task needs them

If the task is long-running and expensive to reload, maintain a short `PINNED.md` with only the facts that must survive context loss.

## Synthesize or emerge mode

Use when the user wants patterns, themes, or cross-source insight rather than local cleanup.

Look for:

- recurring concepts across unrelated recent sources
- people or entities that repeatedly co-occur without an explicit relationship page
- concepts that have evolved through repeated updates
- orphan pages that contain useful ideas but weak link structure
- recurring blockers, energy drains, or strategic themes in recent notes

Outputs can include:

- synthesis pages
- pattern reports
- connection pages
- refreshed hub pages
- short summaries in the daily note or log

Goal: surface what the user has not named yet.

## Reconcile mode

Use when the user wants contradictions resolved or stale knowledge refreshed.

Default flow:

1. Find conflicting claims, reversed decisions, stale entity descriptions, and pages lagging behind newer evidence.
2. Judge each conflict by recency, authority, and whether it is a contradiction or a genuine evolution.
3. Rewrite current-state sections to reflect the best current understanding.
4. Preserve the older state in history, timeline, or evidence sections.
5. If the conflict is genuinely ambiguous, create or update an explicit conflict page or open-thread section instead of pretending it is solved.

Goal: the system should never disagree with itself silently.

## Health or audit mode

Use when the user says health check, audit, lint, cleanup, or gap review.

Check for:

- contradictions
- broken or weak links
- duplicates
- stale claims
- concept gaps
- orphan pages
- missing metadata or repeated-structure defects
- unsupported claims with no raw/source backing
- drift between recurring outputs and the canonical wiki

Group findings by severity and distinguish safe fixes from destructive ones.

## Challenge mode

Use when the user wants their current idea, plan, or assumption pressure-tested against their own history.

Search for:

- prior failures
- reversed decisions
- recorded doubts
- contradictory notes
- similar attempts that ended badly or differently

Output:

- restated position
- counter-evidence with citations
- blind spots
- verdict or caution level

Goal: use the knowledge base as a red team, not a cheerleader.

## Connect mode

Use when the user wants two domains bridged for creativity or transfer learning.

Default flow:

1. Gather the local clusters around both domains.
2. Trace explicit graph paths if they exist.
3. If not, look for structural analogies, shared people, shared patterns, or semantic overlap.
4. Produce a few concrete, actionable bridges rather than vague metaphors.

Goal: create useful creative friction.

## Graduate mode

Use when the user wants an idea turned into an execution artifact.

Default flow:

1. Find the source idea note or fragment.
2. Read linked context, related projects, people, and past decisions.
3. Create or update a project page, plan, or procedure page.
4. Add tasks or board entries if the user tracks work operationally.
5. Mark the idea as graduated while preserving it as the origin point.

Goal: the idea evolves into a plan without losing its provenance.

## Export mode

Use when the user wants the knowledge base exposed to another tool, agent, or review process.

Useful export shapes:

- flat JSON snapshot
- markdown catalog
- compact graph or adjacency list
- filtered export by topic, type, date range, or project

Typical fields:

- path
- title
- type
- summary
- tags
- status
- outgoing links
- incoming links when available
- source references or provenance fields

Goal: make the knowledge base legible outside its native frontend.

## Visualize mode

Use when the user wants a graph, atlas, canvas, or map of the knowledge base.

Storage-agnostic outputs can include:

- `.canvas` for Obsidian users
- Mermaid graphs
- JSON graph exports
- markdown summaries of hubs, clusters, bridges, and orphans

Good defaults:

- center hub nodes
- cluster by page type
- highlight orphans
- show bridge nodes between otherwise separate clusters

Goal: make structure visible without turning the visual layer into the source of truth.

## Confidence mode

Use before committing to a plan, proposal, or decision when the user wants to assess readiness.

This mode answers: what do we actually know here, what are we assuming, and what gaps should be closed before proceeding?

Default flow:

1. State the plan or decision being evaluated in one sentence.
2. List what the knowledge base confirms with high confidence — cited pages or sources.
3. List what is assumed but unverified — plausible but not grounded in evidence.
4. List what is unknown and consequential — gaps that could invalidate the plan.
5. Assign an overall confidence level: high (proceed), medium (close named gaps first), or low (do not proceed without more input).
6. For each gap, name the specific action that would close it: a source to check, a page to write, a question to ask.

Output: a structured readiness summary with a recommendation and specific next steps, not just a list of doubts.

Do not conflate this with Challenge mode. Challenge mode is adversarial — it looks for prior failures. Confidence mode is prospective — it maps what is known versus unknown before acting.

## Work mode

Use when the user wants to execute a plan from the knowledge base.

Default flow:

1. Find the plan page or have the user confirm the plan to execute.
2. Break the plan into tasks with explicit dependencies. Mark which can run in parallel.
3. Execute tasks in dependency order, running parallel work streams concurrently where possible.
4. After each significant task, log progress back to the plan file so the plan stays current.
5. When a task produces a decision, insight, or new fact, route it into the knowledge base immediately — do not defer to a cleanup pass.
6. At the end of execution, trigger Compound mode to extract learnings from the session.

Rules:
- Keep the plan file as the source of truth for what was done, what was skipped, and what changed.
- Never complete Work mode without a Compound mode closing step.
- If a task reveals that the plan is wrong, update the plan before continuing — do not silently improvise.

Goal: execution leaves a paper trail that feeds the next planning cycle.

## Compound mode

Use at the end of every meaningful work session, plan execution, or ingest pass.

This is the closing ritual that makes the knowledge base compound. Without it, sessions add volume but not acceleration.

Default flow:

1. Scan the session for 1–3 durable learnings — things that are true beyond this session and would change how future work approaches similar problems.
2. For each learning, check the knowledge base for an existing page that should absorb it.
3. If an existing page matches: update it, rewrite the compiled-truth section if needed, and append a timeline entry.
4. If no page matches: create a new knowledge file with the standard YAML frontmatter and page structure.
5. Explicitly check for contradictions: does this learning conflict with anything already in the knowledge base? If so, surface the contradiction instead of silently overwriting.
6. Update `LOG.md` and any relevant index files.
7. Report: what was saved, what was updated, and any contradictions found.

Frontmatter schema for new knowledge files:

```yaml
---
type: insight  # insight | decision | procedure | fact | question
tags: [domain, subtopic]
confidence: high  # high | medium | low
created: YYYY-MM-DD
source: session | ingest | research | meeting
---
```

Rules:
- Extract learnings, not events. "We decided X" is an event. "Fast iteration beats perfect planning when scope is unclear" is a learning.
- 1–3 per session maximum. If everything feels important, nothing is. Compress.
- Never skip this step after Work mode. Skipping it is the main way compound systems stop compounding.

## Automation mode

Use when the user wants background maintenance or scheduled runs.

Common schedules:

- morning: daily refresh and due-work pull
- nightly: consolidation, reconcile, synthesize, orphan rescue, index refresh
- weekly: review and recap
- periodic health: audit links, stale claims, and coverage gaps

Rules:

- keep the workflow the same whether it runs manually or on a schedule
- keep secrets out of tracked files
- prefer platform-native schedulers or repo-local scripts that the user can inspect
- require approval for destructive cleanup or ambiguous contradiction resolution
